thoughts: 

solver(.py) partitions

or

solver.py runs mpi, 0th rank partitions, then workers receive partitions


Have solver.py partition and then run mpi with the hostfiles.

worker needs to know
- the original input file
- which partition to use

MPI scatter may be better for the partitions - all partitions? 
    Or maybe you could do a looping thing that also achieves the mpipool functionality?
Is mPI scatter better for the original file?
